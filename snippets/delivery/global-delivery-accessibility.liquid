<p>We only deliver to postal addresses in Australia that normally receive Australia Post mail. A truck with hydraulic tailgate will deliver your order; therefore adequate access for trucks is required. If your home has a steep driveway your order will be delivered to the foot of the driveway. Homes located on narrow streets are not eligible for home delivery.</p>

<p>If your address is not eligible for home delivery, your order will be delivered to the closest depot to your home address. You will be required to pick up the order from the depot. If you are unsure, please <a href="/pages/contact" title="Contact Spacemaker Wardrobes">contact us</a>.</p>
